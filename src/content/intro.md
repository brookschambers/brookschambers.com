Hi there; I’m Brooks! I’m a creative director and brand design leader based in Nashville, Tennessee. I came into creative direction by way of brand strategy and copywriting, thriving on both the big picture and the minute details of every brand I work with. I currently lead Brand Design at [Mode](https://www.mode.com), and hail from companies like Dropbox, Twitch, Loom, and more. For a complete list of companies I've worked with, please check my [résumé](https://brookschambers.com/assets/brooks-chambers-r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf).
